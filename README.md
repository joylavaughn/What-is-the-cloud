<h1>What Exactly is Azure and the Cloud?</h1>
Microsoft Azure, often referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft that provides access, management, and development of applications and services via around the world-distributed data centers. "The cloud" is literally a platform that will let you rent space in order to store or process your own data. Essentially, it’s a term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem. Microsoft Azure is usually described as having “limitless potential” and “unlimited possibilities.”

However not many businesses are aware of cloud storage and hence rely on traditional storage devices. There are a lot of free options available for personal use. You can easily get up to 200 GB of free storage.
