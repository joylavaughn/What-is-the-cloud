<h1>What Exactly is Azure and the Cloud?</h1>
Microsoft Azure, often referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft that provides access, management, and development of applications and services via around the world-distributed data centers. "The cloud" is literally a platform that will let you rent space in order to store or process your own data. Essentially, it’s a term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem. Microsoft Azure is usually described as having “limitless potential” and “unlimited possibilities.”

Here are a few examples of free services you’re likely familiar with: Gmail, Google Docs/ Google Drive/ Dropbox & iCloud. 
Many businesses do not want to rely on hardware that is costly and thereby want to switch their data to the best free cloud storage available. However not many businesses are aware of cloud storage and hence rely on traditional storage devices. There are a lot of free options available for personal use. You can easily get up to 200 GB of free storage.

In Azure, a resource is an entity managed by Azure. Virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage accounts are all examples of Azure resources. It's helpful to know a few basic definitions as you begin your Azure cloud adoption journey: Subscription: A logical container for your resources. Each Azure resource is associated with only one subscription. Creating a subscription is the first step in adopting Azure. Azure account: The email address that you provide when you create an Azure subscription is the Azure account for the subscription. The party that's associated with the email account is responsible for the monthly costs incurred by the resources in the subscription. When you create an Azure account, you provide contact information and billing details, like a credit card. You can use the same Azure account for multiple subscriptions. Each subscription is associated with only one Azure account.
